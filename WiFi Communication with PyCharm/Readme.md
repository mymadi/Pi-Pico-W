## Example 2 (TCP)
PyCharm as **Server** and Pi Pico W as **Client**.

- You need to run the code for PyCharm (Server) to know the HOST/IP. Then, you can updated/edit the HOST/IP number at Pi Pico W (Client).

## Example 3 (**UDP**)
PyCharm as **Server** and Pi Pico W as **Client**. 
- You need to run the code for Pi Pico W (Server) to know the HOST/IP. Then, you can updated/edit the HOST/IP number at PyCharm (Client). 

## Example 4 (**UDP**)
PyCharm as **Client** and Pi Pico W as **Server**.

- You need to run the code for PyCharm (Server) to know the HOST/IP. Then, you can updated/edit the HOST/IP number at Pi Pico W (Client).
